Thanks for purchasing this pakage, I hope you are going to have as much fun building your interiors, as I had compiling this package.

Mobile & Desktop:
The textures sheets has intuative atlas textures usage with a huge amount of prefabs reading of each textures sheet.
The grouping was done if such a way that say all the wooden furniture can be used with another project with eaze.
This will assit with lowered draw calls aspecially when using Static Batching or MeshCombine functions.

Also, all the screenshots and DEMOS that you have seen has been achieved with a Diffuse map only,
so no funnies that a mobile device might not be able to display.

The scenes that was used for the screenshots are all inside the Demo Scenes directory.

The particle effect are easy to use drag & drop prefabs.

Send some screenshots to info@3dforge.co.za of your work and I will showcase them on the website

Grid system:
The tiles/walls/floors have been done with a 2,5 x 2,5 x 3 units grid size.

Doors:
The door items have been exported with the Y Axis being the rotational axis.

Roofs:
I used the floor prefabs, just grab the whole bunch, rotate and vertice-snap them into place.

ProGrids 2:
Using 0.5 as a setting would have it work in all three axis


I would like to invite users to email me there scenes files that they proud of,
they are tiny and I will have a look at them and include them in futiure updates.
Permission to have me use them as I see fit would have to be included in the email.

Credit would be given to creators.


Enjoy
